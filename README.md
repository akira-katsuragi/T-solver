## Introduction

The Triangle Calculator is a C++ program that calculates various properties of a triangle based on user input of side lengths and angles. It supports different input formats such as SSS, SAS, ASA, and SSA.
Input Formats


The program supports the following input formats:

- SSS (Side-Side-Side): Provide three side lengths of the triangle.
- SAS (Side-Angle-Side): Provide two side lengths and the angle between them.
- ASA (Angle-Side-Angle): Provide two angles and the side length between them.
- SSA (Side-Side-Angle): Provide two side lengths and the angle opposite one of them.

## Usage

When prompted, enter a command in the format: Format # # #, where Format is one of the supported input formats (SSS, SAS, ASA, SSA), and # represents a real number for the side length or angle.
Repeat the input process to calculate properties for multiple triangles.
To exit the program, enter QUIT, BYE, or EXIT when prompted for the format.


## Output
The program will output the following properties for each input:

- Perimeter: The sum of all three side lengths.
- Area: The area of the triangle.
- Type: The type of triangle (e.g., equilateral, isosceles, scalene) and its angle type (e.g., right, obtuse, acute).

### Example
#### INPUT:

SSS 3 4 5

#### OUTPUT:

Format: SSS

a =  3  alpha =  36.870

b =  4  beta  =  53.130

c =  5  gamma =  90.000


Perimeter =  12

Area      =  6

Type      =  scalene, right



#### Exiting the Program
To exit the program, enter QUIT, BYE, or EXIT when prompted for the format.
